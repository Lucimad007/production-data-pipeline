# Production data pipeline

Sample extract, transform, and load job for paid orders.

`data/sample_orders.csv` is the source. The pipeline drops refunds, blank customers, non-positive quantities, and duplicate order ids, then upserts the remaining lines into SQLite at `data/output/orders.db`.

## Run

```bash
python -m pipeline.run
```

Optional paths:

```bash
python -m pipeline.run --source data/sample_orders.csv --database data/output/orders.db
```

## Test

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_pipeline
```
